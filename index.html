            Did you know you can use Honey for Weight management?<br />
            According to the famous author and nutritionist Mike McInnes, honey
            burns body fat even while when you are sleeping. It is one of the
            best foods for losing weight. Doctors recommend to have a spoonful
            of honey before going to bed. You can also consume a little honey
            with warm water on empty stomach early in the morning. Having it
            first thing in the morning, helps increase the metabolism, which in
            turn helps reduce weight faster. Honey is also good for improving
            your overall health.

            Honey has countless medicinal properties that naturally help in
            curing a sore throat. Its antioxidants and bacteria-fighting assets
            also help against fighting infections that are caused by viruses,
            bacteria and fungi. According to doctors and scientists, buckwheat
            honey has the highest number of antioxidants and when consumed daily
            can be beneficial for boosting immunity in the long run and this is
            why honey has known to be one of the best immunity boosting foods.
            It is always advisable to consume honey every morning before
            breakfast or even workout to get an extra kick of energy for the
            whole day. It also works as a cleansing toner which improves
            immunity in children.
